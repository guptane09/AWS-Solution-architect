S3 Cross-Account Replication with KMS

Notes
•	The source and destination resources should be deployed to the same region in different AWS Accounts.
•	Deploy the destination account resources first.
•	The destination S3 bucket must exist before configuring replication on the source bucket.
•	CloudFormation stack name: replication-demo
•	Source bucket name syntax: {stack-name}-{source-account}-bucket
•	Destination bucket name syntax: {stack-name}-{destination-account}-bucket

Testing
Upload objects to the source account S3 bucket. The objects should be replicated to the destination account S3 bucket.
